# Advanced Enchantments

This mod adds advanced versions for some of the vanilla enchantments.

- Channeling II: causes a lightning bolt wherever and whenever it is after hitting an entity.
- Silk Touch II: you can mine spawners, reinforced deepslate, budding amethyst and some other blocks (with nbt!).
- Flame II: makes entities burns longer time after hit by arrows.
- Infinity II: also makes spectral arrows and tipped arrows infinite.

And it also adds an enchantment:

- Damp (for chestplates and elytras): you can use tridents with riptide enchantment, take the conduit power effect from conduit in any case, even not in water.
